# CatchingGame
Welcome to the the catch game project, between me, Tami Okubote and my partner, Emilia Barlow whiched we worked on from February-March 2025. This game is pirate-themed catch game, which is why the items included range from gold/barrels/bombs/pearls/swords/rubies/skulls.

These items will fall down the screen and the objective is to catch certain objects - "treasure" (e.g gold/rubies/pearls) into the barrel, which will all be worth different points and added to a score, while avoiding other objects - "weapons" (skulls/bombs/swords) which could either deplete your score and/or end the game. Your target is to get the highest score possible before either you collect 3 weapons in your barrel or miss 5 items of treasure.

The game has mutiple screens, for the start, countdown before the game, gameplay itself, and the final screen, whihc takes you back to the beginning, which lets you start all over again!
